# prohibits active site of all other enzymes, tranlsation also stops
# when it encounters a protected sequence

# It is important to note that the actions/round parameter for the protection unit
# defines the number of targets the unit can bind per round.
# These targets get randomly chosen every round from all available targets on the sequence
# The target positions are then blocked for this round for any number of units.

# in this example the enzymes can act on the when the protection unit gets degraded (after 5 rounds)
