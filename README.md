Sequence Processing
===================

Sequence Processing is a stochastic and discreet cell model.
It was created to simplify the setup of a model, while still allowing for the creation
of elaborate systems.

* New? The [model description](http://github.com/oOo0oOo/sequence-processing/wiki/Model-Description) is a good place to start.
* More about the [sequence syntax](http://github.com/oOo0oOo/sequence-processing/wiki/Sequence-Syntax)
* A list of [all units](http://github.com/oOo0oOo/sequence-processing/wiki/List-of-all-Units) currently implemented.

####Dependencies (install before running the program):

* [Python 2.x](http://www.python.org/getit/)
* [wxPython 2.8](http://wxpython.org/download.php)


I'm only coding since half a year, so all constructive feedback is most welcome!
